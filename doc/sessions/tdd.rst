Week 11 - Test-Driven Development
=================================

.. note:: This page is a draft.

:Topics: Unit testing, test first mindset, red-green-refactor cycle, behavior driven development
:Tools: Nose_, Mocha_, `Should.js`_
:Prep: TODO
:Due: :doc:`/assignments/factoid`
:Homework: :doc:`/assignments/tdd`

.. todo:: Lab ideas:

    * fill in empty test stubs in python unittest for a simple python module
    * fill in empty test stubs in node unittest for a simple node module
    * discuss differences in the testing paradigms
    * start with a set of method stubs with doc describing their function, write tests to check they meet spec, then implement the functions, use watch command to continually monitor test status (red-green-refactor)
