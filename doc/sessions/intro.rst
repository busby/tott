Week 1 - Introduction and Setup
===============================

.. note:: This page is a draft.

:Topics: Course overview, virtual development environment setup
:Tools: SublimeText_, `Package Control`_, `Google Chrome`_, IRC_, VirtualBox_, Vagrant_
:Prep: TODO
:Assigned: :doc:`/assignments/setup`

.. todo::

    Lab ideas, with lots of pre-written steps to follow:

    * start installing host machine tools, install virtualbox, install vagrant, figure out how to vagrant up the course box, figure out how to port fwd to the host machine (1 line of ruby from doc), figure out how to pull down etherpad-lite (1 git command), figure out how to run it with default settings (1 bash command), figure out how to collab over it with someone else (figure out own IP); voila: instant real-time wiki
    * modify the Vagrantfile mount a second shared directory, use npm to install / start http-server, run the server (~3 lines of bash)
