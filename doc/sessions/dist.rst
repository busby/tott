Session #2

:In Progress: :doc:`/assignments/tdd`


.. todo::

    * complete existing setup.py file
    * complete existing package.json file, use interactive package.json tool online
    * find and try equivalent dist file for Ruby (Gemfile)
    * create a dist file for an existing project, possibly one created earlier in the course
    * work through a few license combos to figure out the net license reqs (e.g., LGPL + MIT = ?, GPL + LGPL + BSD = ?,  AGPL + * = ?) (yes, not fun, but this is reality)
