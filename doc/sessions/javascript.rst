    * JavaScript koans
    * create a NodeJS env, npm install wr globally, figure out how to make it run a little script every time you change it
    * npm install a couple common node libraries like optimist and underscore locally, use them in a simple node program to play a guessing game, learn how the nested import tree works in node
    * take a seed project for a little app I started and flesh it out, add features
    * use jerk to build a creative bot for our class irc channel
    * find some node library of interest
