Week 7 - Server-Side Web
========================

.. note:: This page is a draft.

:Topics: Web servers, REST, non-relational data stores (aka NoSQL)
:Tools: Bottle_, ExpressJS_, MongoDB_
:Prep: TODO
:In Progress: :doc:`/assignments/collabin`

.. todo:: Lab ideas

    * build a REST API that models friend-friend-loaned item graphs; use a d3 visualization frontend I give them as a test case for it (they get the eye candy if they succeed)
    * read doc about serving static files, and get either bottle or express to serve up a prior client side example
    * start with a mongodb persist file, run the server using, use the cli to query and modify
    * use a python or javascript client for mongodb to query the same file
