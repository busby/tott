* Learn the basic concepts of the Backbone_ framework
* Recognize the MV* pattern in Backbone
* Understand how Backbone can help structure client-side code
* Practice writing web applications using Backbone

Prep Materials
--------------

If time permits, try to review these resources before the meet-up. If you can't, come anyway.

* Read the `Wikipedia Model-vice-controller article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>`_ (~10 minutes)
* Read `the Introduction section of the Backbone doc <http://backbonejs.org/#introduction>`_ (~5 minutes)
* Read `Why you should use MV* front-end frameworks like Backbone, Ember, and Angular <http://maximilianschmitt.me/blog/web-development/why-you-should-use-mv-front-end-frameworks-like-backbone-ember-and-angular/>`_ (~10 minutes)
* Read `the annotated Todos.js Backbone example code <http://backbonejs.org/docs/todos.html>`_ (~15 minutes)

Exercises
---------

You will need to complete the :doc:`/setup` instructions before you proceed with these exercises. Once you are set up, SSH into *tottbox* using the ``vagrant ssh`` command from the setup instructions. Then tackle the problems below. `Document what you find in a gist <https://gist.github.com/>`_ and share it in the `TotT community`_ later.

Projects

If you want to try your hand at something larger than an exercise, consider one of the following.
