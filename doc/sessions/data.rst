:Tools: `IPython Notebook`_, Pandas_, Matplotlib_
:Prep: TODO
:Due: :doc:`/assignments/tdd`

.. todo:: Lab ideas, I'll furnish some datasets here or ask around for some in the department

    * explore the many, many features of the ipython environment and notebook, document what you find in a new notebook, put it on github as a gist and view using nbviewer
    * load simple dataset (e.g., iris), descriptive stats, plot columns, take notes
    * compute wordcount on a body of text, visualize it
    * find a dataset of your choosing, transform it so that you can use it with Pandas
    * read the matplotlib doc and play with a fun example, try applying it to another dataset of your choosing
    * bring up a set of distributed workers in the ipython notebook, use the ipy API for controlling them to do a map reduce on a large dataset
    * pip install a library right from within the notebook and start using it
