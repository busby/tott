    Lab ideas, with lots of pre-written steps to follow:

    * Use git to clone the etherpad-lite project on GitHub (hint: Google around for how to use git to clone and for where etherpad-lite lives on GitHub). Figure out how to run it with the default settings (hint: find the docs). Figure out what it does and how another classmate can access it to try it with you.
    * fork a class roster repository, add self and send pull request, appears in little hall of fame class roster web app i build (make it fun)
    * practice cloning a class assignment repo, working on it with a partner, pushing back to the submission area on a private git server
    * practice local branching for feature work + merging into master
    * practice stage-commit-stage-commit-etc-pull-merge-push with a partner. See if you can draw a simple diagram of the flow
