====================================

.. note:: This page is a draft.

:Topics: Why everything you create should be in version control, cloning, staging, committing, pulling, pushing, merging, branching, GitHub protips
:Tools: git_, GitHub_
:Prep: TODO
:In Progress: :doc:`/assignments/eval`

.. todo::

    Lab ideas, with lots of pre-written steps to follow:

    * get a github account, fork a class roster repository, add self and send pull request, appears in little hall of fame class roster web app i build (make it fun)
    * practice cloning a class assignment repo, working on it with a partner, pushing back to the submission area on a private git server
    * practice local branching for feature work + merging into master
    * practice stage-commit-stage-commit-etc-pull-merge-push with a partner. see if you can draw a simple diagram of the flow
