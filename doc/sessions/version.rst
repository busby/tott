    Lab ideas, with lots of pre-written steps to follow:

    * fork a class roster repository, add self and send pull request, appears in little hall of fame class roster web app i build (make it fun)
    * practice cloning a class assignment repo, working on it with a partner, pushing back to the submission area on a private git server
    * practice local branching for feature work + merging into master
    * practice stage-commit-stage-commit-etc-pull-merge-push with a partner. see if you can draw a simple diagram of the flow
