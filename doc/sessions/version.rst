Exercises
~~~~~~~~~

SSH into *tottbox* to perform all of today's exercises. Remember to `document what you find in a gist <https://gist.github.com/>`_ and share it in the `TotT community`_ later. Items you *must* complete today are marked with a |star|.

Find a partner
##############

|star| The Git assignment requires that you work with a partner. Find a partner before the end of our session today. If you can't find someone, see me before class ends.

Immerse yourself
################

Visit the `Git Immersion <http://gitimmersion.com/>`_ web site. Starting on `lab #3 <http://gitimmersion.com/lab_03.html>`_, complete all the labs up through #28, skipping #22 and #23. The labs will take you through cloning, staging, committing, branching, and merging in a practice Ruby project. It will also teach you some handy commands supporting the typical git workflow.

.. note:: Don't worry about the Ruby code. It's there to help you practice Git, not learn Ruby. We'll cover Ruby later in the course.

Branch for features

Diagram git
###########

Draw a little diagram of your interactions with git in the Git Immersion tutorial so far. What effect do your commands have on your working directory, the stage, the master branch, and other branches?

Use plain text to create the diagram or an online tool like `actdiag <http://interactive.blockdiag.com/actdiag/>`_.

Update the diagram you drew in the last class session to include the concepts of pulling and pushing. How do these impact your local repository? The remote one?
