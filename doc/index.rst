Summary
=======

Tools of the Trade (TotT) is an elective course for students that want more exposure to the wide variety of tools used in modern software development. The goal of this course is to build student confidence in finding, learning, applying, and evaluating tools through practice. Students will prepare for class by reading and/or watching lectures online about version control, web development, data analysis, dynamic languages, and so on. Students will apply what they have learned in collaborative, hands-on, in-class sessions. Students will integrate the tools and topics introduced in small to moderate sized programming assignments throughout the course as well as a final project.

For more information, see the :doc:`syllabus` and planned schedule below.

Fork This Course
================

I plan to build out the material for this course entirely in the public eye. The source for the course web site, code samples, student Vagrant box, lab exercises, assignment starter templates, and so on all live or will live at http://github.com/parente/tott. If you have a suggestion or see a problem, `open an issue <https://github.com/parente/tott/issues>`_ or `fork and submit a pull request <https://github.com/parente/tott/fork>`_.

Students who enroll in the course should treat the class website as the authoratative reference for assignments, due dates, prepatory reading, etc. On the class site, any page marked as a draft at the top or section having a TODO is subject to change.
