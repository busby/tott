Assignment - Collabin'
======================

.. note:: This page is a draft.

.. todo:: Assignment gist

    Starting from a partially complete web application layout, finish a pastebin application with realtime collaborative editing support in NodeJS using Express, ShareJS, and Redis. Give it a clean UI using jQuery, Dojo, etc. Bonus for using a another UI library not discussed in class, adding cool features (e.g, expiration, syntax highlighting), etc.

.. todo:: Might switch this to one part of a three part assignment building a cooperative web game
