Final Project
=============

.. note:: This page is a draft.

.. todo:: Final project must be a complete project using git, having documentation, having tests, and integrating some tool we have not discussed in class, approved by me very early to make sure the scope is reasonable. It could be an extension of one of the earlier assignments as long as it meets the above criteria.
