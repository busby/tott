    Starting from some partially complete code, write a wallpaper generator that takes a directory of images and builds a single image composed of the smaller pictures, like photographs scattered on a table. Randomly place the images in the wallpaper. Make the application run on the command line. Use [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) in Python.
