Assignment - Bug Hunter
=======================

.. note:: This page is a draft.

.. todo:: Assignment gist

    Write a test suite using mocha.js and should.js that will exercise a Node library. I will implement the library, complete with a few corner-case bugs, and provide you with that code. You will run your test suite against it. Your tests should exercise the library under success and error conditions, and hopefully cause failures revealing the bugs in my code.

.. todo:: Might switch this to one part of a three part assignment building a cooperative web game
