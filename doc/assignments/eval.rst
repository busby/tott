Assignment #1 - Evaluating Tools
================================

.. note:: This page is a draft.

.. todo:: Assignment gist

    Write up a brief evaluation of a set of interelated tools (e.g., cloud provisioners, deployers, image builders, ...). Figure out the dimensions, weigh alternatives, explain how they can be combined. Either I pick the topic or the students do. The latter is harder because the student has to first identify a space with multiple tools. Post should be done in a blog-like format, like the student is teaching others how to use a set of tools.
