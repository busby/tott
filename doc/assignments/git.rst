Assignment - Game Specification
===============================

.. note:: This page is a draft.

.. todo:: Practice the git workflow by working through a step-by-step scenario of using version control with one other classmate to cooperatively write a mocha test specification for an Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (UTTT) game we will build throughout the semester. The instructions will explicitly call out when to branch, commit, merge, push, and pull, and likewise for your partner, in order to produce common conflict and merge situations.
