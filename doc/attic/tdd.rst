.. todo:: Lab ideas:

    * fill in empty test stubs in python unittest for a simple python module
    * fill in empty test stubs in node unittest for a simple node module
    * discuss differences in the testing paradigms
    * start with a set of method stubs with doc describing their function, write tests to check they meet spec, then implement the functions, use watch command to continually monitor test status (red-green-refactor)
