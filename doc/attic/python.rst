    Lab ideas

    * Python koans
    * create a Python virtualenv, install django using pip, follow the django book setup in chp 2 to create first project / app
    * take a seed project for a game I started and flesh it out, add features
    * build out the django app into a simple CRUD site
    * get Pillow installed, look for tutorials, look at terse doc, start to get familiar for assignment
    * get some other fun lib installed like a irc client, twitter client, xmpp client, wordnet, pyttsx, ... and create some simple demo using it
    * python turtle? will it work from the vm?
